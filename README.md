The code presented here is an app that was submited to the Gemini-API-Developer-Competition 2024. The application is very simple: two users compete among themselves in solving a math problem.
The user with the correct solution and the correct answer wins. The potential of the application is enormous: it is possible to embed the application within a social network.
Users will be able to learn from each other and - 

Users can also earn money for a living. How?
The application can be developed so that it will create short videos from the solution and adds can be broadcasted in these videos of the winners in a particulaer math problem.
The demonstration of the app can be found in the link:
