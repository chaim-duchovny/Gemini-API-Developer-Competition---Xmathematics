The code presented here is an app that was submited to the Gemini-API-Developer-Competition 2024. The application is very simple: two users compete among themselves in solving a math problem online.
The user with the most efficient and correct solution with the correct answer wins. The potential of the application is enormous: it is possible to embed the application within a social network.
Users will be able to learn from each other and users can also earn money for a living. How?
The application can be developed so that it will create short videos from the solutions. Adds than will be broadcasted in the winner's video in a particulaer math problem.
The app has also the feature that the app itself can solve the problem presented to it in handwriting for education purposes. 
The demonstration of the app can be found in the link:
